scikit-learnâ€™s inbuilt Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, a widely used, preprocessed collection of clinical data, 
to train and evaluate our Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. This approach enables accurate prediction of breast cancer malignancy,
classifying cases as either malignant or benign by 
leveraging essential features included within the dataset for robust and reliable results.
